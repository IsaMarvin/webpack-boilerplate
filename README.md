## Introduction

This repository provides a basic webpack boilerplate that allows you to quickly set up and bundle your web projects. It includes configurations for bundling JavaScript, CSS, and image assets, as well as setting up a development server for live reloading.

## Features

- Bundles JavaScript, CSS, and image assets.
- Supports development mode with live reloading.
- Provides a simple HTML template to get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsaMarvin/webpack-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd webpack-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the development server and open your default web browser to view the application at http://localhost:8080.

2. Begin developing your application by editing the `src/index.js` file. You can also modify the `src/style.css` file to customize the styles.

3. As you make changes to the source files, the development server will automatically update and reflect the changes in the browser.

4. To build the production-ready bundle, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory that you can deploy to a web server.
